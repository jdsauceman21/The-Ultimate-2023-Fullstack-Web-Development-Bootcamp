GoalKicker

GoalKicker has tonnes of amazing books. Definitely take a look at this free JavaScript Notes for Professionals book. https://goalkicker.com/JavaScriptBook/JavaScriptNotesForProfessionals.pdf

Resources
Mozilla Developer Network has GREAT online JavaScript documentation and references. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

But if you need a quick example or reminder about how something works, I also recommend quickly browsing over w3schools. https://www.w3schools.com/JSREF/DEFAULT.ASP
